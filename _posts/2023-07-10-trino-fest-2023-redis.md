Ever since the pandemic, it has become clear that the need for a digital first
economy is becoming more and more necessary. As Redis' Field CTO Allen Terleto
said during their talk from [Trino Fest 2023]({% post_url
2023-06-20-trino-fest-2023-recap %}), "In a digital first economy, data is the
lifeblood of the organization, which makes the databases the heart of enterprise
architectures". Redis, a popular open source project, is a distributed in-memory
keyâ€“value database. It includes a cache, message broker, and optional
durability. In his talk, Allen demonstrates Redis' new connector for Trino. It
can push down advanced queries and aggregations while leveraging Redis' unique
in-memory secondary indexing. As a result, performance with the new connector is
much higher.

## Recap

Redis is an open source, in-memory, NoSQL database that natively supports a
variety of data structures. Redis is designed for utmost performance and high
throughput use cases across different types of workloads. Redis is widely known
for being the fastest data store in the market with sub millisecond performance,
its ease of use, and being a multi-model database. Redis is able to map
relational tables to a key-value database by adding a key-value pair as a hash
attribute for each column. However, how can you search for a certain key in a
way that scales well in high throughput databases? Redis has a unique way to
deal with this problem: secondary indexing and Redis Search.

Redis Search enables secondary indexing and full-text search, which allows Redis
to support many features such as multi-field queries, aggregations, exact phrase
matching, numeric filtering, geo-filtering, and vector similarity semantic
search on top of text queries. As Allen says, "Redis Search will be at the heart
of our new integration with Trino and game-changing better performance at scale
to the existing Redis Trino connector". In addition, Redis supports a native
data model for JSON documents, allowing you to store, update, and retrieve JSON
values in a Redis database like other Redis data types. It also works with Redis
Search to let you index and query JSON documents.

The syntax for Redis Search is a bit different from traditional SQL syntax, so
Redis is introducing a quicker and more reliable Redis-Trino connector that lets
you easily integrate with visualizations frameworks and platforms that support
Trino. The connector is open source and publicly available on their public
GitHub. In addition, it will be contributed directly to the Trino project.

you can load data from some file system, relational database, or data warehouse
and query it without writing a single line of code.
